# MLP-Cinema-Audience-Forecasting-Challenge-Project
Cinema Audience Forecasting challenge: A Kaggle Competition Project under IITM MLP Project

A time-series forecasting problem centered around cinema audience attendance. The data comes from two separate booking platforms:

- BookNow: an online booking and aggregation platform where users can search theatres and book tickets in advance.
- CinePOS: a point-of-sale (POS) system installed at theaters that tracks on-site ticket sales.
